<h3 id="bart-murphy-cio--oclc">Bart Murphy: CIO @ OCLC</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Hype Cycle of AI&rdquo;
OCLC is that library company that manages book data
Highly concerned with ethics in AI
How does OCLC handle knowing whether or not new book submissions are duplicates?
Made a chatbot for managing tons of Jira tickets
In customer service, LLM&rsquo;s are a bit too expensive to properly replace customer service (long wait times with indexing vectorized data)
Moving towards open source: oLlama, Llama3 : reduce cost
Data curation is a big problem.
Don&rsquo;t underestimate engineering / maintenence cost of AI services.</p>
<h3 id="pinak-barve--mcgraw-hill--vp-of-engineering">Pinak Barve : McGraw Hill : VP of Engineering</h3>
<p>This company uses Go! :)
Learning Impact use cases: reading/writing coach, course builder, risk assessment reporting,
Content creation use case: multi-modal content, metadata management,
Productivity use cases: ai chatbot, multi agent workflows, copilot for coding productivity
A lot of concern over the value of copilot: I&rsquo;m impressed to see this level of forward thinking on the topic.
Discerning whether ai needs to solve a problem, or whether existing tools, or added functionality can solve the issue.
Having AI knowledge base / experts can help elimainate people&rsquo;s concerns and confusions / wrong-steering.
RAG pattern has seen the best results. They haven&rsquo;t needed to go further.
Concern that the AI can use cultural terms &amp; phrases that are offensive in different cultures.
learn the basics of embedding, determining the right way to vectorizing data, chinking, etc.. Good to know for myself.</p>
<p>RAG is being highly promoted, and this pattern was seen as highly hallucination resistant.</p>
<h3 id="community-highlight-maureen-metcalf--junell-felsburg--fauxmo-ai">Community Highlight: Maureen Metcalf : Junell Felsburg : FauxMo AI</h3>
<p>I would say Maureen is fairly idealistic with predictions with technological advancements, and attributes these to AI, and I&rsquo;m not 100% sure how the advancements she predicts are corelated to AI.

<h3 id="junells-presentation">Junell&rsquo;s presentation</h3>
<p>an interesting point on how, games like the oregon trail, or dwarf fortress, how much control do we really have over our team? At some point, our team has more control than the manager. The manager becomes, instead of a itght control, a rudder that stears the ship, but the importance of the team becomes undeniable.
This is a sales pitch for a leadership course.</p>
<h3 id="srini-koushik--rackspace">Srini Koushik : Rackspace</h3>
<p>Responsible AI with FAIR
Great person to talk to about doing AI projects
excited about 5 years AGI. Introduced himself by his age : 60 (mayhaps hopeful for life-enhancing tech evolutions)
technological advancements don&rsquo;t happen in a bubble. If things keep accellerating, it&rsquo;s too difficult for expert to keep up.
Focus on AI making us better at our jobs, not replacing people.
Tries to think of AI assistants as employees. They made 3. One specialized for sales and IT. Another made for IT and has knowledge on IT tickets. Another helps developers keep their code to company standards.
I think it&rsquo;s an interesting metaphor. However, I think these chatbots are extremely specialized to little more than chatbots. I think they are more like an advisor, which are most helpful to new employees.
Issues with cost. Running it on the cloud. 21k/m for 11k queries. Cost does seem to be a real concern. Cloud costs are getting bulky, let alone the costs to OpenAI / Google.</p>
<h3 id="general-notes">General Notes</h3>
<p>A lot of conversations to try and remind people that AI is another technology, nothing magical, or needing to jump into new service building right now, without doing thorough research into what is actully going to save cose.
Check out TechLife website for some event page
I want to work more with RAG ai service pattern, build some cool stuff, clones, chatbots, helpful things, etc.. It does sound like there are real</p>
<h2 id="summary-of-the-conference">Summary of the Conference</h2>
<p>I think Cloud Nirvana was amazing. I am happy I went, although I made some mistakes, I don&rsquo;t think I need make them again. My dress code was perfect for a developer-centric conference, but this was much more C-Suite. I definitely need a jacket, that I can wear a more loose /casual / funny shirt underneath, intead of a Golang hoodie I wore. Most everyone there knew each other, which I found really interesting.</p>
<p>Pinak was my favorite speaker. I think his company is both interesting, using Golang as its primary language (or at least the one he personally advocated). I think I took the most notes from his talk, and notes that are valuable because I felt inspired by his presentation, his understanding, and the fact that his background is from engineering, not data / leadership specifically. It makes me wonder if a leadership role is something that is in store for me. I love engineering, building, architecting solutions. I think much of leadership is about meetings, which will always be what pushes me away from it.</p>
<p>Although I didn&rsquo;t meet many new people, I gained some presence in the community, I got to reinforce my learning on what kinds of AI projects to focus on, learned some about the tools people are using to create these projects, it definitely moved me in a direction of being able to speak more proficiently about how to architect, and cautiously approach AI solutions. Important skills I can bring to Wasserstrom, and my own side projects.</p>
