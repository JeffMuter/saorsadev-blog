      More Game-Dev | Vacation | Focus Game Dev Since beginning to work on my game, I haven&rsquo;t made many posts on the blog. I have been engrossed in the project from head to toe. I haven&rsquo;t ever found any project quite so fun to build and the challenges have been enlightening.
Part of what convinced me to make a game, was watching a video by Jonathan Blow, discussing that, when you get good at one kind of programming, it creates a plateau.

      Professional API Research At work, I had been given the opportunity to do a ton of research into what API we plan to use for a service. Never have I been required to go this deep on the documentation of several different API&rsquo;s, their pricing plans. Going back and forth with our analytics team to see what exactly we needed. It forced me to flex my brain in a very different way.

      Templating Blog Post / Completed Templating/Golang/Postgres Work Project / GameBoy Color Development Templating Blog Post As I struggled with a work project that required some midly complex Golang templating, I came up against the reality that I simply wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to get a fix to my issue without either abusing ChatGPT, or learning it thoroughly myself. Of course the first is the quick and easy option, however, it leaves that come impossible to maintain, and not to mention, I am left no better of a developer.

        Making Sense of Golangs Templating
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      In this article, I want to discuss a flexible approach to templating in Golang. By keeping a flexible approach, I mean my aim is to avoid complicated explanations, in favor of explaining the surface level of the main approaches I see myself, and others take when templating. One of the great parts of Golang is that it strives towards simplicity, and in that pursuit, there should generally be one straightforward way of doing things.

      Weekly Dev Update Creating Content &amp; Developing User Registration Registration Form This week, what I spent the most time building was the continued work on my registration form. Returning to a sort of mid-level phase, adding sessions to a database, not stored locally in a map. This is nearly complete, but I hope to get that complete, and begin adding tests. I haven&rsquo;t made database unit testing in Golang, so that&rsquo;s something that really excites me.

        Simplifying Middleware in Go

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Simplifying Middleware in Go I want to discuss some of the discoveries, and challenges, I ran into while building a Golang http web server, and making the authentication part of the application. Since I have not been using any frameworks, the process does get a bit deep, far moreso, comparatively to the ease by which other frameworks and languages remove the technical details of an application via abstractions. However, I stand by the idea that understanding a process without abstractions, is the best way to approach bugs, foreign code(code you are unfamiliar with), and also helps you to pick up new concepts quickly when encountering something novel.

      Weekly Dev Update 1 Arden Labs Golang in AI Webinar
This week I had a chance encounter! I was listening to &lsquo;Cup O&rsquo; Go&rsquo; podcast, where Bill Kennedy mentioned some of the trainings that Ardan Lab does, which led to me seeing the Ardan Labs was sponsoring a free Webinar on how to use Golang to create AI services! So many of my side projects related to AI were shelved because of how commited I am to learning Golang.

      Weekly Dev Update Building a Web Server &amp; Creating This Blog Building a Golang Web Server from the ground up I turned a basic empty Golang project, into my first attempt at building a web server. This has been much harder than I thought. There is so much about building a Golang web server that is significantly different from the API&rsquo;s I built in Java in the MVC design pattern. On top of learning new Go concepts, learning a new folder structure, the terms that go along with this kind of project has been seriously jarring.
