        <p><strong>Arden Labs Golang in AI Webinar</strong></p>
        <p>This week I had a chance encounter! I was listening to &lsquo;Cup O&rsquo; Go&rsquo; podcast, where Bill
          Kennedy mentioned some of the trainings that Ardan Lab does, which led to me seeing the Ardan Labs was
          sponsoring a free Webinar on how to use Golang to create AI services! So many of my side projects related to
          AI were shelved because of how commited I am to learning Golang. However, I have had some bad experiences with
          conferences of late. Where I kept attending teaching events where the content was far too broad, tailored too
          specifically to beginners, or my favorite &rsquo;this could have been an email&rsquo;. However, I was
          delightfully surprised at the level of this Webinar. I felt like my horizons expanded for what kinds of
          projects I can build using AI with strictly Golang! I learned a lot more about the &lsquo;RAG&rsquo; approach,
          and how fine-tuning should generally be seen as a last resort. I have a lot of reading to do for Golang, but
          this really inspired me to consider giving some of the Ardan Lab Golang courses a shot in the future, once
          I&rsquo;ve at least hit an intermediate level.</p>
        <p><strong>Building Web Server</strong></p>
        <p>I have been taking building an API to the next level, by building this web server. There were many challenges
          along the way, but I think the MVP is fully complete. I hooked up the PostgreSQL database, then got to work
          with some HTMX templates to create a nice login form, that switches to the registration form. You can register
          users, login, and the middleware package helps to protect routes that should require credentials. I chose a
          cookie / session approach because I am not a fan of JSON. One of the future goals would to make the
          authentication a little more fleshed out, more than an mvp. On registration, I need to make sure said email
          doesn&rsquo;t already exist. I should be requiring a password length (symbols &amp; numbers don&rsquo;t
          protect a user enough to justify the hassle). I need logout, and sessions to be managed on the database, as
          right now it exists in server memory in a hashmap.</p>
        <p>Sometime next week, I need to decide what kind of kind of app I want this simple web server / form to become.
          After what I learned from the webinar, I should probably dig up one of my old AI project ideas and just begin
          moving that into an MVP phase.</p>
