<p>My own game written in Go is coming along. I plan to make a full post about my experiences so far. I have had a ton of trouble with it, however, I am really proud of what it is and has accomplished so far. I still have many hurdles to overcome, so just one hurdle at a time&hellip;</p>
<p>As of right now, I can login, and Google&rsquo;s Geolocate API assists in getting the users location on all the tech I use, Linux, Windows, and even mobile. Getting a location based on Wifi was made pointlessly more difficult by my own complex machinations. Eventually I deleted that nightmare and started over to get eventual success. The user pops up at their location. The screen renders a map of, basically, all of Ohio right now. You can see where you are compared to the game-world objects. For now, those are just cities, but I know I&rsquo;ll eventually be zooming the map in. There will be locations in National Parks, historical locations, and more. But until I can automate that, I just plan to make dummy data in Ohio.</p>
<p>Speaking of rendering, most of this week was spent learning how to get game ASCII art to render onto the screen the way I wanted it to. Having to overcome a ton of hurdles to move from one step to the next with the rendering. I did a lot on my own by hand. I am simply not the best with mathematics. When it came to rotating a 2D vertex, I finally let ChatGPT play a small influence and help me understand that process. However, after that, the only tricky part with rendering is getting terrain to display. I was rivers to be where real rivers are, forests where forests are. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be perfect, we&rsquo;re just going to do out best here. But the world&rsquo;s a big place, and there simply aren&rsquo;t many places that have the amount of data, for free, that I need to make an MVP of this work.</p>
<p>As you can see, this is an AR game. The only other that has hit the mainstream being Pokemon Go. Except this one I want to play from a terminal. Install, run the command, and play. Which sounds rediculous, and it is, and I love it.</p>
<h2 id="techlifecolumbus-meetup">TechLifeColumbus Meetup</h2>
<p>I had the opportunity to check out this Meetup in Hilliard Ohio. I had never seen old Hilliard, it was incredibly pretty, and had a great atmosphere that is really hard to maintain with the size of their city.</p>
<p>Many amazing people and conversations ensued. More and more networking has become a chance to talk to people I consider more and more as simply friends. I got to talk about Golang, listen to people excitedly discuss their passion for soccer, helped some people brainstorm about their side projects, and more.</p>
<h2 id="goland">GoLand</h2>
<p>This week, my stint with VSCode came to an end. Not for any reason I&rsquo;m used to hearing. Simply, the debugger in Golang had updated, and I could not debug several projects, infuriatingly, this varied from machine to machine, from project to project. I tried every decent method I could to debug the debugger, however, in the end, I sucked up the yearly subscription and made the jump to Goland. Goland is a JetBrains IDE, which I loved when I tried it in my bootcamp, however, the ease of use for debugging was really the only selling point I needed. While there are many &rsquo;nice to have&rsquo;&rsquo;s with a JetBrains IDE, most people know I turn off Intellisense, as I&rsquo;m simply not quite ready for such great autocompletion. I don&rsquo;t mind a popup of a list of methods I can use on a type when I do: &lsquo;sometype.&rsquo;, but when I make a new line, and it wants to inject a whole line of code for me, you&rsquo;re removing my option to put in the effort. I am very anti-ai generated code at the moment anyways. I simply want autocomplete on functions and variables, and leave me to create my own bugs that I intentionally screwed up, not make code for me, then me have to look into why the code was generated that way, and debug from there&hellip; After disabling that however, Goland has been buttery smooth and dreamy. I can hover to see documentation, which I never realized I needed. I still have a long ways to &lsquo;Go&rsquo;, but its been a great start.</p>
